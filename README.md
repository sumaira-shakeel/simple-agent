1Ô∏è‚É£ import os
This imports Python‚Äôs os module, which helps you interact with the operating system.
In your case, you're using it to get values from environment variables (your .env file).

2Ô∏è‚É£ from dotenv import load_dotenv
You are importing load_dotenv() function from the python-dotenv package.
It allows you to load key-value pairs from a .env file into your Python program.

3Ô∏è‚É£ load_dotenv()
This line loads your .env file, making the API key available to your code.
Your .env file contains something like:

ini
Copy
Edit
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_real_key_here

4Ô∏è‚É£ gemini_api_key = os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY")
Here, you are fetching the API key from the environment and storing it inside the gemini_api_key variable.
üí° This is your secret key to access the Google Gemini API.

6Ô∏è‚É£ model = OpenAIChatCompletionsModel(...)
This creates a model object that represents the "Gemini AI Model" you are using (in this case "gemini-2.0-flash").
It will handle the actual interaction with the Gemini API behind the scenes.

7Ô∏è‚É£ agent = Agent(...)
This creates your personal AI agent.
You give it:
A name: "Greeting Agent"
Some instructions: How this agent should behave (friendly greetings in your case).
The model: The Gemini AI you just created.
üí° This agent will follow your rules to answer users.

8Ô∏è‚É£ user_question = input("please enter your question: ")
This asks the user to type something.
Whatever you type will be stored in the variable user_question.
For example, if you type "Hi", it will save "Hi" to user_question.

9Ô∏è‚É£ result = Runner.run_sync(agent, user_question)
This runs the agent.
It sends the user_question to your agent.
Runner.run_sync() means you are running it in a synchronous (normal) way.


üîü print(result.final_output)
This prints the agent's final answer to the screen.
For example:
If you typed "Hi", it might print:
Salam from Sumaira Shakeel! How can I assist you today?



‚úÖ Summary
You:

Loaded your API key.
Connected to Gemini API.
Built a custom greeting agent.
Took user input.
Sent it to the agent.
Printed the reply.
